# Medplum MCP Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the steps to build a Medplum Command Platform (MCP) for interacting with a Medplum FHIR server via a chat-based interface powered by an LLM. The MCP will provide tools for creating, reading, updating, and searching FHIR resources.

**General Workflow Note:** After completing each phase or significant step that results in runnable code or configuration changes, we will identify and execute relevant test or verification commands. For commands requiring interaction with the local Medplum instance or user-specific setup, I will prompt you to run them and then analyze the output you provide. For self-contained checks (e.g., linting), I may run the command directly.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation

- [x] **Initialize Node.js Project & Install Dependencies**
    - Notes:
        - Ran `npm init -y`.
        - Installed `@medplum/core`, `@medplum/fhirtypes`.
        - Installed dev dependencies: `typescript`, `@types/node`, `ts-node-dev`, `nodemon`, `eslint`, `prettier`, `@typescript-eslint/*`, `eslint-config-prettier`, `eslint-plugin-prettier`, `jest`, `@types/jest`, `ts-jest`.
        - Installed `dotenv` to manage environment variables.
        - Installed `node-fetch@^2` and `@types/node-fetch@^2` for explicit fetch in MedplumClient.
- [x] **Configure TypeScript**
    - Notes:
        - Created `tsconfig.json` using `npx tsc --init`.
        - Configured `rootDir`, `outDir`, `target`, `module`, `esModuleInterop`, `strict`, `skipLibCheck`, `resolveJsonModule`, `include`, `exclude` as per plan.
- [x] **Setup Project Structure**
    - Notes:
        - Created directories: `src`, `src/tools`, `src/config`, `src/lib`, `tests`.
        - Created `src/index.ts` as the main entry point.
- [x] **Implement ESLint and Prettier**
    - Notes:
        - Created `.eslintrc.js`, `.prettierrc.js`, and `.prettierignore`.
        - Added `lint`, `format`, `build`, `dev`, `start` scripts to `package.json`.
- [x] **Medplum Client Configuration**
    - Notes:
        - Created `src/config/medplumClient.ts`.
        - Initialized Medplum client to connect to `http://localhost:8103/` (or `MEDPLUM_BASE_URL` from `.env`).
        - Implemented `ensureAuthenticated` function using Client ID/Secret from `.env` (via `dotenv`).
        - Explicitly configured `fetch` using `node-fetch`.
- [x] **Basic Connection Test**
    - Notes:
        - Created `src/test-connection.ts`.
        - Script successfully authenticates using client credentials from `.env`.
        - Script successfully fetches server capabilities using `medplum.get('fhir/R4/metadata')`.
        - Script successfully fetches the client application's profile using `medplum.getProfile()`.
        - Added `test:connection` script to `package.json` and verified it runs.
        - Runtime successful, though linter shows type errors for `get` and `getProfile` (using `@ts-ignore` for now).

## Phase 1.5: Initial Tool & LLM Test Harness

- [x] **Implement a Single Simple MCP Tool**
    - Notes:
        - Choose one straightforward tool from Phase 2, e.g., `searchPractitioners` or a simplified version of `createPatient`.
        - Implement this tool in `src/tools/` using the Medplum SDK. (Implemented `searchPractitionersByName` in `src/tools/practitionerSearch.ts`)
- [x] **Develop Basic LLM Test Harness (Simulated Chat)**
    - Notes:
        - Create a script or simple interface (e.g., a command-line tool) that can take a natural language string as input.
        - This harness will send the input to an LLM (via its API, configured with the schema of the implemented tool).
        - The purpose is to observe and verify the tool call generated by the LLM, not to build a user-facing chat UI at this stage. (Implemented `src/llm-test-harness.ts` using OpenAI GPT-4o)
- [x] **Define Schema and Configure LLM for the Initial Tool**
    - Notes:
        - Create the JSON schema for the first implemented tool (as described in Phase 3).
        - Configure your chosen LLM to use this tool. (Created `src/tools/toolSchemas.ts` and used it in the test harness with GPT-4o)
- [x] **Write Initial LLM Integration Test Case**
    - Notes:
        - Formulate a natural language query that should trigger the implemented tool.
        - Send this query through the test harness.
        - Verify that the LLM attempts to call the correct tool with the correct parameters.
        - This forms the first test in our iterative LLM integration suite. (Included several test queries in `llm-test-harness.ts` `main` function, verified LLM tool selection and parameter extraction)

## Phase 2: Core FHIR Resource Tools (MCP Tools)

For each resource, we need tools for `create`, `readById`, `update`, and `search`. Each tool should be a well-defined function in `src/tools/`.

- [ ] **Tool: `managePatient`**
    - Description: Handles Patient resources.
    - Sub-actions:
        - `createPatient(details: Patient)`: Creates a new patient.
            - SDK: `medplum.createResource<Patient>(patientResource)`
        - `getPatientById(id: string)`: Retrieves a patient by their ID.
            - SDK: `medplum.readResource<Patient>('Patient', id)`
        - `updatePatient(id: string, updates: Partial<Patient>)`: Updates an existing patient.
            - SDK: `medplum.updateResource<Patient>({ ...existingPatient, ...updates })`
        - `searchPatients(criteria: Record<string, string>)`: Searches for patients based on criteria (e.g., name, identifier).
            - SDK: `medplum.searchResources<Patient>('Patient', criteria)`
    - Notes: Pay attention to required fields for Patient creation. Map natural language (e.g., "my dad") to structured FHIR data.

- [ ] **Tool: `managePractitioner`**
    - Description: Handles Practitioner (e.g., doctors, nurses) resources.
    - Sub-actions:
        - `createPractitioner(details: Practitioner)`
        - `getPractitionerById(id: string)`
        - `updatePractitioner(id: string, updates: Partial<Practitioner>)`
        - `searchPractitioners(criteria: { name?: string, specialty?: string, identifier?: string })`
            - SDK: `medplum.searchResources<Practitioner>('Practitioner', { name: 'Tom', ... })`
    - Notes: For "Dr. Tom", criteria would be `{ name: 'Tom', family: 'Stevens' }` or similar. Need to handle parsing of names and titles.

- [ ] **Tool: `manageOrganization`**
    - Description: Handles Organization resources (e.g., hospitals, clinics).
    - Sub-actions:
        - `createOrganization(details: Organization)`
        - `getOrganizationById(id: string)`
        - `updateOrganization(id: string, updates: Partial<Organization>)`
        - `searchOrganizations(criteria: { name?: string, address?: string })`
    - Notes: Useful for linking practitioners and encounters to specific facilities.

- [ ] **Tool: `manageEncounter`**
    - Description: Handles Encounter resources (e.g., doctor visits, hospital stays).
    - Sub-actions:
        - `createEncounter(details: Encounter)`: Links to Patient, Practitioner(s), Organization.
        - `getEncounterById(id: string)`
        - `updateEncounter(id: string, updates: Partial<Encounter>)`
        - `searchEncounters(criteria: { patientId?: string, date?: string, practitionerId?: string })`
    - Notes: Encounters are central to tracking patient interactions. Ensure `status`, `class`, `type`, `subject` (Patient reference), `participant` (Practitioner reference), `serviceProvider` (Organization reference) are correctly populated.

- [ ] **Tool: `manageObservation`**
    - Description: Handles Observation resources (e.g., lab results, vital signs, X-ray findings).
    - Sub-actions:
        - `createObservation(details: Observation)`: Links to Encounter, Patient.
        - `getObservationById(id: string)`
        - `updateObservation(id: string, updates: Partial<Observation>)`
        - `searchObservations(criteria: { patientId?: string, code?: string, encounterId?: string, date?: string })`
    - Notes: `code` (LOINC, SNOMED CT), `value[x]`, `subject`, `encounter` are key fields. "Sed test" would map to a specific LOINC code. "X-ray" also.

- [ ] **Tool: `manageMedicationRequest`**
    - Description: Handles MedicationRequest resources (prescriptions).
    - Sub-actions:
        - `createMedicationRequest(details: MedicationRequest)`: Links to Patient, Practitioner, Medication.
        - `getMedicationRequestById(id: string)`
        - `updateMedicationRequest(id: string, updates: Partial<MedicationRequest>)`
        - `searchMedicationRequests(criteria: { patientId?: string, medicationCode?: string, prescriberId?: string })`
    - Notes: Differentiate between MedicationRequest and Medication (the actual drug).

- [ ] **Tool: `manageMedication`**
    - Description: Handles Medication resources (details about a specific drug).
    - Sub-actions:
        - `createMedication(details: Medication)` (less common, often Medications are pre-loaded or referenced)
        - `getMedicationById(id: string)`
        - `searchMedications(criteria: { code?: string, name?: string })`
    - Notes: Used by MedicationRequest. Might involve searching a drug database or pre-loaded list.

- [ ] **Tool: `manageEpisodeOfCare`**
    - Description: Handles EpisodeOfCare resources to group related encounters and conditions.
    - Sub-actions:
        - `createEpisodeOfCare(details: EpisodeOfCare)`: Links to Patient, managingOrganization.
        - `getEpisodeOfCareById(id: string)`
        - `updateEpisodeOfCare(id: string, updates: Partial<EpisodeOfCare>)` (e.g., change status, add encounters)
        - `searchEpisodesOfCare(criteria: { patientId?: string, status?: string, type?: string })`
    - Notes: Crucial for the "ongoing health episode" concept. Encounters, conditions, procedures can be linked.

- [ ] **Tool: `GeneralFhirSearch`**
    - Description: A more generic search tool if specific resource type is unknown or for broader queries.
    - Action: `searchResource(resourceType: FHIR_RESOURCE_TYPE, queryParams: Record<string, string>)`
    - SDK: `medplum.search(resourceType, queryParams)`
    - Notes: Provides flexibility but requires careful query construction.

## Phase 3: LLM Interaction & Orchestration

- [ ] **Define Tool Schema for LLM**
    - Notes: For each MCP tool developed (e.g., `createPatient`, `searchPractitioners`), define a JSON schema that the LLM can understand for function calling. This includes function name, description, and parameter definitions.
    - Example for `searchPractitioners`:
      ```json
      {
        "name": "searchPractitioners",
        "description": "Searches for medical practitioners (doctors, nurses, etc.) based on criteria.",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "name": { "type": "string", "description": "Full or partial name of the practitioner." },
            "family": { "type": "string", "description": "Family name (surname) of the practitioner." },
            "specialty": { "type": "string", "description": "Medical specialty of the practitioner." }
          },
          "required": [] // Define as appropriate
        }
      }
      ```

- [ ] **LLM Request Handling in MCP**
    - Notes: The MCP needs an entry point (e.g., a main function or an API endpoint if this were a separate service) that receives requests from the LLM (which would include the tool name and parameters).
    - This layer will parse the LLM's request, validate it, call the appropriate MCP tool, and then format the tool's response to send back to the LLM.

- [ ] **Natural Language to Tool Parameter Mapping Strategy**
    - Notes: This is largely an LLM task (using the tool schemas), but the MCP tool design should facilitate this.
    - The LLM needs to extract entities like "Dr. Stevens", "PCP", "x-ray", "sed test", "steroids", "rheumatologist" and map them to the correct parameters for the MCP tools.
    - For "PCP", the LLM might first call `searchPractitioners` with name "Stevens" and then the application logic (or LLM itself) might need to confirm if this is the PCP, potentially by checking `Encounter` history or `EpisodeOfCare.careManager`.

- [ ] **Clarifying Questions Logic (MCP Support)**
    - Notes: If the LLM cannot fill all required parameters for a tool, or if there's ambiguity, it needs to ask the user.
    - The MCP might need to support this by:
        - Tools returning information that helps the LLM formulate a question (e.g., if a search returns multiple practitioners).
        - Potentially, tools that can present options to the user via the LLM (e.g., "Did you mean Dr. John Stevens or Dr. Jane Stevens?").

- [ ] **Context Management & Resource Linking**
    - Notes:
        - The LLM needs to maintain conversation context to understand references like "his PCP", "the osteodoctor from last week".
        - When creating new resources (e.g., an `Observation` for the sed test), the MCP tools must accept parameters to link them to existing resources (e.g., `encounterId`, `patientId`).
        - Example flow for "Dr. Stevens ordered a blood panel":
            1. LLM identifies "Dr. Stevens" -> `searchPractitioners(name: 'Stevens')` -> gets Practitioner ID.
            2. LLM identifies "blood panel", "sed test" -> maps to Observation codes.
            3. LLM identifies the current Encounter (or creates one if necessary, linking to Patient and Dr. Stevens).
            4. LLM calls `createObservation` for the blood panel and `createObservation` for the sed test, linking both to the Encounter and Patient.
            5. The `EpisodeOfCare` for the father should be identified or created, and the new `Encounter` linked to it.

- [ ] **Error Handling and Feedback to LLM**
    - Notes: MCP tools should return clear success/failure messages and any relevant data or error details. The LLM will use this to inform the user or adjust its strategy.

## Phase 4: Advanced Features & Refinements

- [ ] **Semantic Search Implementation**
    - Notes: Beyond simple field-based search.
        - If Medplum supports text search across resources or specific fields (`_text` or `_content` parameters), leverage that.
        - Otherwise, this might involve fetching relevant resources and then using an embedding model + vector search locally within the MCP or as a separate microservice if searching large amounts of text data (e.g., clinical notes, though this example focuses on structured data). For now, focus on Medplum's built-in search.
        - "User mentions a 'doctor tom' so we do a provider search on a doc w first name 'tom'" will primarily use `searchPractitioners` with appropriate name parameters.

- [ ] **Complex Utterance Decomposition (Primarily LLM task, MCP enables)**
    - Notes: The example sentence is complex: "today my dad saw Dr. Stevens, his PCP, and he showed him the x-ray that the osteodoctor from last week took. So then Dr. Stevens ordered a blood panel that included a sed test and said that, you know, when the results come in tomorrow, he will make a determination whether to write a prescription for more steroids or to refer him to a rheumatologist."
    - The LLM needs to break this down into a sequence of actions/tool calls:
        1. Identify/Create Patient ("my dad").
        2. Identify/Create Practitioner ("Dr. Stevens", "PCP").
        3. Create Encounter for today with Patient and Dr. Stevens.
        4. Identify/Reference existing Observation ("x-ray from osteodoctor last week"). This implies a previous encounter and observation that need to be found.
        5. Create Observation for "blood panel" linked to current Encounter.
        6. Create Observation for "sed test" linked to current Encounter.
        7. Log future potential actions (MedicationRequest for steroids, Referral to rheumatologist - potentially as `ServiceRequest` resources or notes within the `Encounter` or `EpisodeOfCare`).

- [ ] **Testing Strategy**
    - Notes:
        - Unit tests for each MCP tool (using Jest/ts-jest). Mock Medplum SDK calls.
        - Integration tests: Connect to the local Dockerized Medplum. Create a patient, then an encounter for that patient, then an observation for that encounter. Verify data integrity at each step.
        - E2E testing (manual for now): Converse with the LLM and verify data in Medplum.

- [ ] **Expand and Iterate on LLM Integration Tests**
    - Notes:
        - Continuously update and expand the test harness and test cases developed in Phase 1.5 as new MCP tools are built.
        - **Test individual tool calls:** Ensure the LLM correctly identifies and calls individual MCP tools based on a variety of simple natural language prompts. Verify parameter extraction and mapping.
        - **Test sequential/complex tool calls:** Develop scenarios where the LLM must make multiple tool calls in sequence. This includes using the output of one tool call as input for another to fulfill a complex user request (e.g., the detailed example utterance).
        - **Test context handling:** Ensure the LLM, with the support of the MCP and conversation history, can correctly resolve references (e.g., "his PCP," "that medication").
        - **Test clarifying questions:** If tools are designed to help LLMs ask clarifying questions, test these scenarios.

## Phase 5: Deployment & Operations (Future Consideration)

- [ ] **Containerize MCP (Optional)**
    - Notes: If the MCP becomes a standalone service.
- [ ] **Logging and Monitoring**
    - Notes: Track tool usage, errors, performance.
- [ ] **Security and Compliance**
    - Notes: Ensure all interactions with Medplum are secure, and data handling complies with HIPAA if applicable. OAuth for Medplum client.

## Broader Application Context (Future Considerations)

- **Application-Layer Database for Caretaker-Specific Information:**
    - For a full-fledged caretaking application, an intermediary database will likely be necessary. This database would reside alongside the Medplum EHR and the MCP.
    - **Purpose:** Store information specific to the caretaker and their use of the application, which doesn't belong in the patient-centric EHR.
    - **Examples of data stored:**
        - User accounts for the caretaking app.
        - Mappings of colloquial references (e.g., "my dad," "Dr. Smith") to specific FHIR resource IDs (Patient IDs, Practitioner IDs) in Medplum. This allows for natural language disambiguation.
        - Caretaker preferences, notes, or relationships that are not part of the formal medical record.
    - **Interaction:** The LLM or application logic would query this database first to resolve user-specific references before using the MCP tools to interact with the EHR.
    - **Tools:** This application layer might have its own set of tools (e.g., `resolve_user_reference`, `get_caretaker_preferences`) that would be used by the LLM in conjunction with the MCP tools that target the EHR.
    - **Scope:** While the design and implementation of this application-layer database and its associated tools are out of scope for the initial MCP-EHR integration project detailed above, it's a key component of the envisioned end-to-end chat-based caretaking application.

This plan provides a high-level roadmap. Each checkbox represents a significant task that may involve further sub-tasks and design decisions. The "Notes" field should be updated by the AI engineering agent as each step is implemented, detailing choices made, challenges encountered, and specific Medplum SDK features or patterns used.
